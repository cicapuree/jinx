            <h2>About Jinx</h2>
            <p>A manic and impulsive criminal from Zaun Crest icon Zaun, Jinx Jinx lives to wreak havoc without care for the consequences. With an arsenal of deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and brightest explosions to leave a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake. Jinx despises boredom and gleefully brings her own chaotic brand of pandemonium wherever she goes.</p>
            <p>Jinx grew up in Zaun Crest icon Zaun as a sweet and innocent girl who loved tinkering with machinery but never quite fit in. However, a horrible tragedy changed her into a completely different person who delighted in acts of destruction. Jinx eventually became a widely known criminal, first gaining notoriety through her anonymous “pranks” on the citizens of Piltover Crest icon Piltover, particularly those with connections to the city's ruling houses. These pranks ranged from mildly annoying to extremely dangerous, causing chaos and mayhem throughout Piltover and Zaun. Law enforcement attributed these to other gangs in Zaun, and Jinx was annoyed by this, deciding to make it clear that her future "pranks" were going to clearly mark her as their perpetrator from then on. Soon, word of her began to spread around and she became the most widely known criminal in both cities, causing mayhem and destruction wherever she went.</p>
